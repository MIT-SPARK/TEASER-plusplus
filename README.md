TEASER++ is a fast and robust point cloud registration framework written in C++. It can solve the rigid body transformation problem between two point clouds in 3D. TEASER++ also has bindings for MATLAB and Python, as well as integration with ROS for easy testing and visualization.

## Dependencies
Building TEASER++ requires the following libraries installed: 
1. Eigen3 >= 3.3
2. PCL >= 1.9 (optional)
3. Boost >= 1.58 (optional)

If you want to build Python bindings, you also need:
1. Python 2 or 3 (make sure to include the desired interpreter in your `PATH` variable)

If you want to build MATLAB bindings, you also need:
1. MATLAB 
2. CMake >= 3.13

TEASER++ uses the Parallel Maximum Clique ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6256), [code](https://github.com/ryanrossi/pmc)) for maximum clique calculation. It will be downloaded automatically during CMake configuration. In addition, CMake will also download Google Test and pybind11 if necessary.

## Getting Started
### CMake
Ensure that your CMake version is at least 3.10. Clone the repo to your local directory. Open a terminal in the repo root directory. Run the following commands:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
If you want to install relevant headers and shared libraries, run `make install` after the above commands (you may need to `sudo`).

### Available CMake Options

| Option Name            | Description         | Default Value |
|------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
|`BUILD_TESTS`             | Build tests         |  ON           |
|`BUILD_TEASER_FPFH`       | Build TEASER++ wrappers for PCL FPFH estimation | OFF |
|`BUILD_MATLAB_BINDINGS`   | Build MATLAB bindings | OFF |
|`BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS`  | Build Python bindings | ON |
|`BUILD_DOC` | Build documentation   | ON |
|`BUILD_WITH_MKL`| Build Eigen with MKL  |  OFF|
|`BUILD_WITH_MARCH_NATIVE`| Build with flag `march=native` | OFF |
|`ENABLE_DIAGNOSTIC_PRINT`| Enable printing of diagnostic messages | OFF |

### Run Tests
You can run the tests by running `ctest` in the `build` directory. To generate the Doxygen documentation, run `make doc`, and you should be able to view the Doxygen files in `build/doc` folder. 

By default, the library is built in release mode. If you instead choose to build it in debug mode, some tests are likely to time out. 

To run benchmarks (for speed & accuracy tests), you can execute the following command:
```shell
ctest --verbose -R RegistrationBenchmark.*
```
The `--verbose` option allows you to see the output, as well as the summary tables generated by each benchmark.

The library has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04. 

## How to use TEASER++
To use TEASER++ in your C++ project, please refer to the source code and Doxygen documentation for details. Here's a short C++ snippet that you may find helpful for integrating TEASER++ in your code:
```c++
#include <Eigen/Core>
#include <teaser/registration.h>

Eigen::Matrix<double, 3, Eigen::Dynamic> src(3, N);
Eigen::Matrix<double, 3, Eigen::Dynamic> dst(3, N);

// Populate src & dst with your correspondences ...

// Populate solver parameters
teaser::RobustRegistrationSolver::Params params;
params.cbar2 = 1;
params.noise_bound = 0.01;
params.estimate_scaling = false;
params.rotation_estimation_algorithm = teaser::RobustRegistrationSolver::ROTATION_ESTIMATION_ALGORITHM::GNC_TLS;
params.rotation_gnc_factor = 1.4;
params.rotation_max_iterations = 100;
params.rotation_cost_threshold = 1e-6;

// Initialize solver
teaser::RobustRegistrationSolver solver(params);

// Solve
solver.solve(src, dst);

// Get solution
auto solution = solver.getSolution();
```

For a short example on how to use the MATLAB bindings for TEASER++, please refer to [this](matlab/README.md) document.

For a short example on how to use the Python bindings for TEASER++, please refer to [this](python/README.md) document.

To use TEASER++ in a ROS environment, simple clone the repo to your catkin workspace.

## Known Issues
- When using the MATLAB wrapper with MATLAB on terminal (`-nojvm` option enabled), you might encounter errors similar to this:
`/usr/local/MATLAB/R2019a/bin/glnxa64/MATLAB: symbol lookup error: /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2019.4.243/linux/mkl/lib/intel64_lin/libmkl_vml_avx2.so: undefined symbol: mkl_serv_getenv`. One way to get around this is to run the following command in the environment where you start MATLAB: 
`export LD_PRELOAD=/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_intel_lp64.so:/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_gnu_thread.so:/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_core.so`. You may need to change the paths according to your MKL installation.
