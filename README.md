TEASER++ is a fast and certifiably-robust point cloud registration library written in C++, with Python and MATLAB bindings.

## About
![](doc/banner.png)
*Left: correspondences generated by [3DSmoothNet](https://github.com/zgojcic/3DSmoothNet) (green and red lines represent the inlier and outlier correspondences according to the ground truth respectively). Right: alignment estimated by TEASER++ (green dots represent inliers found by TEASER++).*

TEASER++ can solve the rigid body transformation problem between two point clouds in 3D. It performs well even if the input correspondences have an extremely large number of outliers. For a short conceptual introduction, check out our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xib1RSUoeeQ). For more information, please refer to our paper:

## Getting Started
### Supported Platforms
TEASER++ has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with g++-7/9 and clang++-7/8/9.  

### Installing Dependencies
Building TEASER++ requires the following libraries installed: 
1. A compiler that supports OpenMP. See [here](https://www.openmp.org/resources/openmp-compilers-tools/) for a list. 
2. CMake >= 3.10
3. Eigen3 >= 3.3
4. PCL >= 1.9 (optional)
5. Boost >= 1.58 (optional)

Run the following script to install all required dependencies:
```shell script
sudo apt install cmake libeigen3-dev libboost-all-dev
```

Run the following script to install PCL from source:
```shell script
# Compile and install PCL 1.91 from source
PCL_PACKAGE_DIR="$HOME/pcl"
mkdir "$PCL_PACKAGE_DIR"
cd "$PCL_PACKAGE_DIR"
wget "https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/archive/pcl-1.9.1.zip"
unzip pcl-*.zip
rm pcl-*.zip
cd pcl-* && mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j $(python3 -c 'import multiprocessing as mp; print(int(mp.cpu_count() * 1.5))')
sudo make install
```
Notice that PCL is not required for the TEASER++ registration library. Installing it merely allows you to build example tests that uses PCL's FPFH features for registration. 

If you want to build Python bindings, you also need:
1. Python 2 or 3 (make sure to include the desired interpreter in your `PATH` variable)

If you want to build MATLAB bindings, you also need:
1. MATLAB 
2. CMake >= 3.13

TEASER++ uses the Parallel Maximum Clique ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6256), [code](https://github.com/ryanrossi/pmc)) for maximum clique calculation. It will be downloaded automatically during CMake configuration. In addition, CMake will also download Google Test and pybind11 if necessary.

### Compilation and Installation
Clone the repo to your local directory. Open a terminal in the repo root directory. Run the following commands:
```shell
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/TEASER-plusplus.git

# Configure and compile
cd TEASER-plusplus && mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# Generate doxygen documentation in doc/
make doc 

# Run tests
ctest

# Install shared libraries and headers
sudo make install
```

### Available CMake Options
Here are the available CMake options you can turn on/off during configuration:

| Option Name            | Description         | Default Value |
|------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
|`BUILD_TESTS`             | Build tests         |  ON           |
|`BUILD_TEASER_FPFH`       | Build TEASER++ wrappers for PCL FPFH estimation | OFF |
|`BUILD_MATLAB_BINDINGS`   | Build MATLAB bindings | OFF |
|`BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS`  | Build Python bindings | ON |
|`BUILD_DOC` | Build documentation   | ON |
|`BUILD_WITH_MARCH_NATIVE`| Build with flag `march=native` | OFF |
|`ENABLE_DIAGNOSTIC_PRINT`| Enable printing of diagnostic messages | OFF |

For example, if you want to build with the `march=native` flag (potentially faster at a loss of binary portability), run the following script for compilation:
```shell script
cmake -DBUILD_WITH_MARCH_NATIVE=ON ..
make
```
Notice that by default the library is built in release mode. To build with debug symbols enabled, use the following commands:
```shell script
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
```

### Run Tests
By default, the library is built in release mode. If you instead choose to build it in debug mode, some tests are likely to time out. 

To run tests and benchmarks (for speed & accuracy tests), you can execute the following command:
```shell
# Run all tests
ctest 

# Run benchmarks
ctest --verbose -R RegistrationBenchmark.*
```
The `--verbose` option allows you to see the output, as well as the summary tables generated by each benchmark.

## How to use TEASER++ 
### In CMake-based C++ Projects
When installing TEASER++, CMake will export the following targets that can be included in other CMake projects using `find_package()`:
- `teaserpp::teaser_registration`: the core registration library
- `teaserpp::teaser_io`: library for importing `.ply` files
- `teaserpp::teaser_features`: convenience wrappers around the PCL FPFH library, and simple feature matching functions

A minimally-working `CMakeList.txt` looks something like this:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(teaserpp_example)

set (CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)

find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED) 
find_package(teaserpp REQUIRED)

# Change this line to include your own executable file
add_executable(cpp_example cpp_example.cpp)

# Link to teaserpp & Eigen3 
target_link_libraries(cpp_example Eigen3::Eigen teaserpp::teaser_registration teaserpp::teaser_io)
```

In the `examples/` folder, you can find two C++ examples that can be compiled with CMake:
- [`cpp_ply`](/examples/cpp_ply): showing how to import `.ply` files and perform registration with TEASER++
- [`cpp_fpfh`](/examples/cpp_fpfh): showing how to use TEASER++ with FPFH features

### In Python
In the `examples/` folder, you can find two C++ examples that can be compiled with CMake:
- [`python_ply`](/examples/python_ply): showing how to import `.ply` files and perform registration with TEASER++ and Open3D
- [`python_3dsmooth`](/examples/python_3dsmooth): showing how to use TEASER++ on descriptors generated by [3DSmoothNet](https://github.com/zgojcic/3DSmoothNet) on the 3DMatch dataset, with Open3D visualization

For a short documentation on how to use the Python bindings for TEASER++, please refer to [this](python/README.md) document.

### In MATLAB
For a short documentation on how to use the MATLAB bindings for TEASER++, please refer to [this](matlab/README.md) document.

### In ROS
To use TEASER++ in a ROS environment, simple clone the repo to your catkin workspace.

## Known Issues
- If you are encountering segmentation faults from PMC, try add the environmental variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS=${MAX_THREADS}` (replace ${MAX_THREADS} with the maximum number of threads available on your machine) in your current shell. You can also just prepend `OMP_NUM_THREADS=${MAX_THREADS}` when running your executable.
- When using the MATLAB wrapper with MATLAB on terminal (`-nojvm` option enabled), you might encounter errors similar to this:
`/usr/local/MATLAB/R2019a/bin/glnxa64/MATLAB: symbol lookup error: /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2019.4.243/linux/mkl/lib/intel64_lin/libmkl_vml_avx2.so: undefined symbol: mkl_serv_getenv`. One way to get around this is to run the following command in the environment where you start MATLAB: 
`export LD_PRELOAD=/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_intel_lp64.so:/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_gnu_thread.so:/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_core.so`. You may need to change the paths according to your MKL installation.
